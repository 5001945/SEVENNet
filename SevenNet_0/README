Pre-trained SevenNet-0 model

Refer to the paper for details of the SevenNet-0 model.

checkpoint_sevennet_0.pth: Checkpoint of SevenNet-0 model, used for fine-tuning.
serial_model/deployed_serial.pt: Deployed serial SevenNet-0 model, used for MD simulation combined with LAMMPS.
parallel_model/deployed_parallel_{0-4}.pt: Deployed parallel SevenNet-0 model, used for MD simulation combined with LAMMPS.
fine_tune.yaml: Example training input file for fine-tuning or further enhancing SevenNet-0 model.

Note that you can obtain the same deployed models by running the following command (-p for parallel):
$ sevenn_get_model {-p} checkpoint_sevennet_0.pth

Refer to example_inputs/md_{serial/parallel}_example/ for their usage in LAMMPS.

Both serial and parallel model gives same results but parallel model enable multi-GPU MD simulation and serial model enable stress output in MD.
We're currently developing stress output for parallel model.
